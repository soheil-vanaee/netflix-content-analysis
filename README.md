# netflix content analysis

This project analyzes Netflix data to understand content trends and patterns. It covers data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis using real-world data science workflows. The goal is to build a structured, extendable project following best practices.

### Before anything else,
i used artificial intelligence to help with:

* Correcting the spelling of this text
* Writing the README
* And I wanted the project structure to follow the standards

I wanted to develop it with principles and frameworks. I used AI to help me with the folder and file structure.

## Now, what things did I use and learn in this project?
In the Netflix data analysis project,
I got familiar with the process of a real-world data science project.
I learned how to clean the data and break the project into small, manageable, and extendable parts.

## Check the project structure
Make sure the following files and folders exist:

* ```data/netflix_clean.csv``` (clean dataset)

* ``` notebooks/analysis.ipynb``` (Jupyter notebook for analysis)

* ```src/preprocessing.py``` (Python script for preprocessing)

### Run the Jupyter Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook to start your analysis:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb
```
